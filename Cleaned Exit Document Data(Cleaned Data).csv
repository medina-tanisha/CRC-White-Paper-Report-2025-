BCCJH - Exit Paperwork - Copy.pdf,The Boulder County Climate Justice Hive,"
The organization needs more time for writing 
grants. They’re reticent about applying for 
grants that they won’t necessarily receive.
The organization needs a more efficient 
method of searching for applicable grants.
The organization needs a clear vision for the 
future and a way to set and track long-term 
goals, in order to help them avoid mission 
drift in seeking grant funding.
The organization needs more unrestricted 
grant dollars to be able to provide staff with 
more employment benefits (health insurance, 
security, etc…) and address overall staff 
capacity issues.
The organization needs to develop a method 
for cooperating with other organizations that 
perform similar work in order to submit 
collaborative grant proposals.
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made
Develop a theory of change/logic model. Shifted to focus on organizational 
development/future planning/CGA.
Discuss a process and templates for creating 
potential MOUs & partnership agreements for
grant applications.Discussed fiscal sponsorship. Since intake, 
BCCJH has become a registered 501(c)(3) & 
a fiscal sponsor for other non-profits.
Research different grant opportunities.
Help create a grant calendar template for 
organization.
Look at and review potential and past grant 
proposals.Reviewed previously submitted BCCJH grant 
proposals. Reviewed and created multiple 
drafts of an internal CGA, for future use and 
development. Discussed and reviewed CGA 
attachments document.
Other Things Explored
Created chart of demographic county census data, discussed nondiscrimination policy & gave 
template, review organizational budgets & financial documents, introduced grants readiness 
checklist, discussed volunteerism value & in-kind donations, discussed board of directors,

","Lori, Silas, and Ivy were sweet throughout the journey and were super helpful. 
 Coming from trust – have the breadth and depth of knowledge to understand the NPO 
world and standards in CO. Know where the bar is, and how to help raise it for us. 
Helped us raise the bar.
 “Community Resource Center has the breadth and depth of knowledge to understand the 
nonprofit world and standards in Colorado. CRC know’s where the bar is, and how to 
help raise it for us. This program helped us raise the bar.”
 Felt like we were in good hands.","-Yes.
-The process with GrantCorps was very helpful. 
-The template of the basic information you need to have covered – and the text that they 
can have to copy and place in any grant – will help avoid mission drift. 
-Helping them ID their mission, goals – so that they don’t drift when applying for grants. 
-Got the feeling that this is informed by CRC’s relationships with philanthropy in CO. 
-The standard language that GrantCorps helped develop will be super helpful.","Talking things through with Lori was exceptional. 
 At the end of every meeting, when Silas would put a bunch of links in the chat – things 
discussed and helpful resources. Then, following up with resources in a follow up email. 
 Silas (VISTAs) taking notes, and following up with more information.","-Are working on Board Development to support the organizations they are providing 
sponsorship for.","At the beginning of the program, having a chart of goals and track these things as they 
moved along through the process; and including the # of total sessions. 
 Create a document – what will be covered in sessions, and what we still will be able to 
cover with remaining hours.","  
(From Lodi) The one piece I'd ask for follow up, now that we are providing fiscal hosting, would
be what sort of supports and resources might the GrantCorps program or CRC be able to offer 
those projects.
 Setting up fiscal sponsorship – resources  Open Collective Association – folded.

**
The following is a summary of the activities and results of the 15 hours of coaching and indirect 
support (5hrs direct/10hrs indirect) offered since September 2024 with the support of GrantCorps
Intern Avery Saenz:
1.Funder Relationships:  We reviewed past and potential funders and discussed 
approaches for retaining and securing additional funding partners; talked through Colo 
Health Foundation and Daniels Fund, looked together at the website to find alignment; 
reviewed and discussed Caring for Colorado Part 1 application, reviewed and provided 
comments before submission. Talked through the difference between applying to 
Government vs Foundations and the use of anecdotes, and personal connection. 
Recommendation: when talking to funders include a comprehensive summary of the 
organization's initiatives and goals;  if the foundation is interested in one specific 
program; give more details about including potential outcomes and impact of that 
program.
2.Colorado Common Grant Application  ; We developed a General Operating Template 
draft using language from past grants and information provided during our conversations.
Created strong language for the first 3 sections of the application; talked through the 
evaluation section and the importance of providing numbers served and measurable 
outcomes that can then be reported on once the grant year is completed. We reviewed and
talked through the Colorado Common Grant list of Attachments; Recommendation: Read
through and check for consistent formatting (single spacing, spaces between paragraphs, 
4 page limit); Save all templates, grant calendar and attachments in one consistent folder, 
so everything is easy to find and update with new information.
3.Prospective Grants: Started a Grants Calendar spreadsheet for planning and tracking; 
practiced using the Colorado Grants Guide to identify potential funders; Avery 
researched and identified 8 new prospective foundations to apply to this year and entered 
details into the Grants Calendar.
Recommendations for Next Steps:  
1  Apply for the Denver Foundation's  Technical Assistance Grant; hire a consultant to support 
the organization in creating a short and long term strategic plan; to include a resource 
development plan for supporting general operations2  Based on your vision to involve youth and families in advocacy/systems change; share more 
about plans for how to do this through education and leadership.
3  Set a goal to apply for at least one general operating (GO) grant each month; expect 30% to be
funded in the first year and grow from there; ie: apply for a total of $150K to receive $50K; if the
proposal is declined ask for feedback when possible from contact at the foundation.
As I mentioned after getting  to know your programs and work; I feel confident that you are well 
positioned to secure additional and consistent general  operating grants to support all of Show and
Tell's work/programs  into the future.  
Feel free to reach out with questions and/or let me know how it is going, best of luck to you and 
everyone at Show and Tell in 2025!

GrantCorps EXIT SUMMARY & FEEDBACK DOCUMENT_Tarjama Ensemble_MAP - Copy.pdf,"Tarjama Ensemble, Fiscal Sponsor: Musical Ambassadors of Peace","
Administrative paid support! Learned difference of staff – getting paid for 
work, and Board that is separate, and is 
supporting the mission. Will do specific Board 
recruitment – to bring on people that can 
fundraise, do bookkeeping. 
Will hire a grant-writer, videographer, etc.. for 
things that are not getting done. 
Have created a timeline for how they will do 
this. 
Fundraising (currently no paid staff as part 
of Ensemble)
?Need marketing help
?Ability to rent larger venues for 
events
?Increase attendance at eventsRevamped a lot of different things as part of this
process. Found it impossible to work with Fiscal
Sponsor. Took Board Structure Seminar (2-Part 
CRC series), was an eye opener – we are not 
that model. 
ID’d they have limited capacity, and so are 
going to work with Fiscal Sponsor, AND... real 
need (to bring immigrants musicians together to 
create their own programming) - do this WITH 
them, not for them. Sees role with newly formed
“Rythm of Tabla” - to develop NEW org, and 
with partners she has identified. 
 
Has made some good funder connections with 
Boulder Arts funders. 
+ Service with GrantCorps has brought to light 
disagreements with sponsor – have influenced 
the decision to start their own nonprofit.
+ Have found individuals to be on the board.
Is now recognized on the MAP website!
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made
1:1 coaching on how to create a concise 
narrative/concise verbiage (messaging) 
about the Tarjama Ensemble. Consultant developed a narrative synthesis – 
Org now has a document that delivers a 
consistent message including a structure that 
covers Org. Background, Staff (Ensemble), 
Need/Impact, Programs/Services/Activities, 
Inclusiveness, and Planning.   
Funding research : assistance identifying 
potential funders/grantors! VISTAs demonstrated how to use the Colorado 
Grants Guide and helped identify a couple of 
funding opportunities. 
-Some of the entries were out of date... 
feedback from Meg. Add some grants 
that are from the City & County level !
-Specifically cited City of Boulder, 
Broomfield; reach out to Lauren Click – 
Arts Program Manager, City of Boulder 
Assessment of internal systems  for grant 
developmentPerformed grant readiness assessment, including
discovery of needs to develop org to be eligible 
for grant funding. 
Reviewed online resources, such as the Candid 
library and Nonprofit Ready, so they can access 
information about how to develop their 
nonprofit moving forward.  Past Grant Feedback Reviewed a past grant report and discussed 
feedback around the budget (showing in-kind 
costs/full costs to conduct the performance). 
Reviewed many of the narratives shared and 
developed a cohesive narrative the Org can use 
that touch on organizational background, 
members (staff), target population, need, 
inclusivity, and costs.
Other Things Explored
?Discovered Tarjama is not an established nonprofit. There is potential to create a 
nonprofit with Rhythm of Tabla (Nabin).  
?Discussed questions about board governance. They have a list of potential board 
members and verbal commitments.  Org signed up for CRC’s Board Training offered 
this month (March 2023).

?“GrantCorps was an experience that validated the mission, passion, and goals of me 
personally and the organization.” (Meg) (participant)
?Meg appreciated how we made her aware of the dysfunction in her 
organization/program/current system, and that she learned about concepts relating to 
organizational structure, like nonprofit lifecycles, through GrantCorps and CRC trainings.?Terry helped Meg see that “there are a lot of (grant) opportunities, if you can wrap your 
mind around it (the databases and systems to do grants research).” Terry showed me 
different ways of looking at grants to apply for.”
?Matthew was so genuinely excited about the project.
?Assessing relationship with fiscal sponsor was a great reflection that was brought to light 
by coaching. Meg learned about the life cycle of nonprofits, and how this applies to her 
fiscal sponsor org.

?IDEA FOR IMPROVEMENT  : Following up after meetings with an email to 
summarize next steps, and information shared. Can recordings be shared? 
“I can tell you; this has been a life changing experience. Working with GrantCorps has been 
transformational in discovering what was not working for us, and in restructuring an organization
that will truly support our goals.”"," Timeframe for personal and professional reasons felt challenging for engaging in services. Will

Lack of time was a challenge for the

Case for Support (Mission, Vision, Goals):
A strong Case for Support - and how does 
their budget align with this case  The consultant completed a final session with 
their new ED to do a topline recap. 
-Now, Mary feels like they are really 
moving because having someone else 
(new ED) supporting their work is 
making a big difference.
-Lori suggested new file organization 
that was helpful – and Mary “would 
never have thought about”

GrantCorps EXIT SUMMARY & FEEDBACK DOCUMENT (CDP) - Copy.pdf,Colectivo de Paz,"
Colectivo de Paz lacks staff trained in grant 
writing and staff in general.Partially – and gaps were due to the point 
person trying to bring team in and people 
were not available. Clare received a lot of 
training. 
Colectivo de Paz lacks resources to research 
grant funding opportunities. The 
organization’s current grant research process 
is opportunistic rather than systematic – there 
is no concrete grant research process in place. 
The organization is aware of grant research 
databases but lacks the assets necessary to 
access them.A little bit of this. One of the challenges was 
that a lot of the private foundations – required
ED position, which CDP does not have. Basic
eligibility requirements made it challenging. 
Colectivo de Paz needs an effective system 
for tracking and reporting on funding.Made some progress and wasn’t what they 
prioritized as much. Was some discussion on 
this. Could consistently use the spreadsheet 
they already have in place! 
Colectivo de Paz needs training in general 
nonprofit management processes.  
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made
Grants research– Provide direction & 
training to sourcing open grant databases and 
recommend at least 3 potential matches 
researched by GrantCorps.
Grant Training and informational 
opportunities:
IRS and Gov’t compliance (Gov’t Grant 
Agreements Training)
UEI through Sam.gov
Grants research (FFW, Get Grants, coaching 
opportunity)
Training in developing grant program 
narratives, including an organizational logic 
model
Grant planning: A method of tracking grants
applied for and received should be developed 
to enable Colectivo de Paz to manage a steady
flow of grant applications and grants that 
align with organizational goals.

",help address the grant development needs we identified,"3.Silas - What activities and services provided by GrantCorps were most helpful to you and
your organization? 
Why?
?Website work stands out – because it’s “out there,” and everyone goes there to learn 
about the organization, including funders. 
?Information about inputs/outputs – (Silas provided) – when he is considering a grant, he 
is reviewing the Logic Model to determine if the grant is a good fit, and how to answer 
the questions.
?Learned to call funders to ask if funding is a fit and read the grant announcement in 
alignment with his program/organizational documents. 
4.Eugene - Did you apply for any NEW grants as a result of the program? ( Take notes for 
this question on the table above. )
If so, which ones? What were the $ amounts requested?
Have any of these grants been awarded? They are still pending. 
?He has also identified other grants that he has found on his own. Is going to wait to apply 
for others until he learns about these that are pending, and can learn from the experience. 
5.Silas - How can we improve the program?
?This was his first time in this type of program, and so his experience working with NPO 
capacity building is new. Hard to compare this experience to any other, and what we 
could do differently. 
?“You gave me the tools, and you gave me what I needed.”
?“I feel pretty good about going after grants after working with GrantCorps.”
?You are doing a good job, you helped me with messaging and with the website. 
?You did well. “Jhon did great; he put us on the right path. His knowledge and experience 
was really helpful and kept us on track.”
6.Eugene - Anything else you would like us to know?
?Ibrahim shared that he is using TikTok to connect with grant opportunities – key word – 
“grants” and videos pop up with information about grants – grant announcements; how to
apply, etc…
?Has also used AI to generate an application, and applied for a grant for his wife’s 
organization, and received a $15K grant! 
?Also connected with the small business development center (SBDC), they are going to 
help with electronic drop off, and applying for grants and start-up loans.

Learning what goes into a grant application, 
balancing data and stories from her 
community.Having the CGA application language, how 
we can talk about many different categories of
work all in one place. 
More insights into what funders are looking 
for. Working through the CGA was helpful. 
When looking for data or numbers. 
Learning the nonprofit funding ecosystem, 
such as funders changing their giving 
priorities; cultivating ongoing relationships 
with funders (currently sends invites to 
events). Has seen funding moving away from 
education to economic development. Has a grant application list they were able to 
compile with the avg. amount they give. This 
is helping her figure out what fundraising gap 
they have for the year. 
How to package what they do. They can apply
for arts, health funding, education funding - 
creating an application for each of these

","So specific to grantwriting, it was really good to pull a lot of info from the trainings and 
workshops to create an internal guide. 
 Has someone on her team that wants to help with grantwriting, and she was unsure about 
how to weave it into the fold. She put the info into a slide deck, and now she has the info 
to do this work. She also went into the CGG and pulled grants that could be a fit for 
them. 
 Working with Sarah – and in b/w meetings. The refined a CGA and common grant 
attachments.",Unknown,"Trainings – covered everything. Even though some of it was the basics, seeing it 
all together was really helpful, and then was able to relay the basics to someone 
else on her team. 
Coaching – left coaching with tangible deliverables – such as the CGA. 
Info sitting in my brain is not as helpful as an actual document tracker !","Talked about – Caring for Colorado  – received an invite for the second round! LOI in 
fall. Full application due in February. $50k for general operating!
-Arts & Society – declined
-CHFA – Direct Affect Award – declined 
-Denver Office for Children’s Affairs  – approved! First gov’t grant! $25k, 
reimbursement grant.","She had a really good experience. Doesn’t have anything that immediately comes to mind. “ I am
leaving the program with tangible next steps, and I feel very prepared for 2025 !” 
As she is thinking of training another person – kind of coaching that would allow two people to 
participate. 
** Adding a slide with most commonly outsourced grant activities – volunteers, contractors, 
Board members – how can the team get involved in the process? **","  
**
The following is a summary of the activities and results of the 15 hours of coaching and indirect 
support (5 hours direct/10 Indirect) offered since September 2024.1.Grants Strategy 2025:  We reviewed past and potential funders and discussed 
approaches for retaining and securing additional funding partners to meet budgetary goals
for 2025; Offered feedback regarding past Grant Proposals, the suggestion is to focus 
more on general operating requests and share about the organization's work overall and 
its evolution since it began; and if the foundation is interested in a specific program; 
provide details (outputs) and potential outcomes and impact of that program (the logic 
model template and SMARTIE goals sheet are great tools to help you to think these 
through).
2.Colorado Common Grant Application  ; Using language from past grants and 
information provided during our conversations,  Sarah started a strong General Operating 
Template draft; as discussed it will need to be simplified  to fit the 4 page requirement 
(look for repetition and embrace brevity :). Add information regarding the Board, current 
collaborations, and future planning; read through and check for consistent formatting 
(single spacing, spaces between paragraphs); We reviewed the Colorado Common Grant 
list of Attachments and talked through how to present the information; ie: highlight that 
many of the consultants/staff hired have been program participants and family members.   
3.Grants Calendar:   Shared an example of the grant tracker; a simple way to track active 
and potential funders in one place; practiced using the Colorado Grants Guide to identify 
additional potential funders for general operating support.   
4.Prospective Grants List: This list is in addition to those that you already have applied to
recently:
oVirginia Hill Foundation  $10K  Send Common Grant and Attachments to 
Rebecca.Olchawa@wellsfargo.com   (also there may be other foundations that are 
managed by Wellsfargo that are a match; Mabel Hughes is one; they will want a 
strong evaluation plan) https://www.wellsfargo.com/private foundations/
oAnschutz Family Foundation  $10K Jan/June deadlines
oGiving   The Connie Burwell White & William White Foundation  
oFunding Overview   Grants to Organizations   A.V. Hunter Trust  
Also, keep an eye out for these funding organization's deadlines in the Fall or sooner:
oBonfils Stanton https://www.bonfils stantonfoundation.org/grants/equity in arts 
learning for colorado youth  looking for a partnership with artist/art org  same as Art 
365; next letter of intent is in Sept
oLCFC  May come out with an RFP in 2025; make sure you are on their mailing list
oColorado Trust (get on the email list for the next grant cycle)
oMHUW  SIG (they are on the list of grant recipients)
Also, I thought you  might be interested in this resource, 
https://www.transformativeleadershipforchange.org/ , it is a fellowship program for Leaders of 
Color; they are currently accepting applications for the 25/26 Cohort.  
As I mentioned after getting  to know your unique and incredible programs and work; I feel 
confident that you are well positioned to secure additional and consistent 
general operating grants to support Convivir's work into the future.   
Feel free to reach out and let me know how it is going and best of luck to you and everyone at 
Convivir in 2025!  Be Well!  Sarah

Exit Paperwork (The Lounge) - Copy.pdf,The Lounge,"
Knowing what grant opportunities are out 
thereYES, the VISTA team did a great job or 
both teaching them how to do grant 
research, as well as providing real 
opportunities. We also taught them how to 
assess if a grant is really a match.
Aligning the organization, values, and needs, 
with funder prioritiesWe spent a LOT of time helping her with 
the story and narrative. We worked on 
vision, mission, values, back story of 
founder, organizing the narrative to make 
it easy for funders to see what the Lounge 
is doing currently, and their vision for the 
future. We also talked about “not chasing 
money” that isn’t theirs (doesn’t align with
their mission and programming).
Identifying Capital Grants, as the organization
is looking for a permanent locationThey are in no way ready for capital 
grants. We discussed that right now, the 
permanent space is a longer-term goal and 
that they have a lot of work to focus on 
right now with their services before moving
to a capital campaign. They do not have a 
building identified, nor are they in a 
financial place to start a capital campaign. 
This was a lot of the challenges we had 
with them at first. They were all over the 
board on what they wanted/needed. We 
talked a lot about “shoring the ship” first, 
and then working on a strategic plan that 
could include the building.  
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made
Assistance developing budget(s) for grant 
applications, and aligning expenses with grant
asksYes, we helped her develop a budget that 
was truly in line with what she is doing, not
what she hopes to do in the future.
Coaching on how to ask for feedback when a 
grant is declined. This could include 
reviewing a declined grantWe talked about asking for feedback when 
the funder will provide it. I think many of 
her declines in the past were based upon a 
poorly written grant that was confusing to 
funders.
Support interpreting funder alignment when 
seeking new grant opportunitiesYes, we did this.
Support identifying grant opportunities and 
understanding application guidelinesYes, we walked through many grant 
opportunities and helped her see which 
ones were truly prospects vs. “chasing 
money”.

Blue Elements - GrantCorps EXIT SUMMARY & FEEDBACK DOCUMENT - Copy.pdf,Blue Elements,"
Emily is the only person on staff at Blue 
Elements, and she is relatively inexperienced. 
As such, the time to develop and submit grant
proposals and the amount of training so far 
provided to staff about grant writing and 
research are both lacking.
Grant writing capabilities must also take into 
account the rural communities in which Blue 
Elements operates. Local resources are thin, 
the businesses and community funding 
sources are not rich, so there is little financial 
capital in the local region.
Blue Elements is also a relatively new 
organization; therefore, it has a limited 
financial and organizational history. In the 
short life of Blue Elements, some grants have 
been applied for with a fiscal sponsor and 
Blue Elements has been the lead (or only) 
applicant on some. Grant applications may 
have to overcome this short history.
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made

applying forYes.
Assistance/capacity with grant writing Are still understaffed. Is hard to keep up with 
the grants that are of potential to the 
organization. Kathy still feels overwhelmed. 
Feedback on submitted grant applications I thought the feedback was great. We’ll be 
going back to how it was, and it was really 
great having people outside of the 
organization look at these grants. You brought
fresh perspectives and asked questions we 
might not have thought of.
Tools and systems for tracking grants and 
applying for grantsWe had a system previously, but we’re using 
this excel system now and that seems to be 
working well.

AI Notes: 
  GrantCorps provided around 75 hours of consultation and support to ECOC 
over a period of around 7 months. This included grant writing assistance, 
training opportunities, and feedback on grant applications.  ECOC appreciated GrantCorps' responsiveness and the fresh perspective 
provided in editing grant applications. This helped strengthen their 
applications. 
  GrantCorps helped expand the types of grants ECOC applied for by 
researching additional opportunities and ensuring good alignment between 
grants and ECOC's work. This increased the number and size of grants 
applied for.
  Tools like an Excel spreadsheet for grant tracking and research on funders 
like reviewing 990 forms helped build ECOC's capacity for grant development
and management."

Grantwriting (additional capacity):  
Organization has not done a lot of 
grantwriting, and hasn’t received many 
grants.Organizational Assessment & Goals for 
Programming: Met with Jorge to develop a 
plan; once Denine was hired included her in 
meetings; this served in part as an orientation 
to the organization for Denine.  Introduced 
SMARTIE Goals and a LOGIC MODEL.
Denine: There was a high need for 
grantwriting help, so the Common Grant 
Application helped a lot with that
Grant Research: Organization is not sure 
where to look for grants. (Jorge: we were 
starting from ground zero, we needed 
everything with respect to what GrantCorps 
was offering)Prospective Grants: Marcy offered an ½ 
hour of training on the Colorado Grant Guide,
and Denine used the guide to start identifying 
potential funders.
Grants Research:  Grants received have been
program/project specific and very restricted. 
There is a need for operational grant funding.Colorado Common Grant Application and 
Attachments: Denine and Sarah developed a 
General Operating Template draft using 
language from past grants and information 
that Jorge provided during our conversations. 
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made
Grants research, and specifically for less 
restrictive operating grants that align with 
their mission.Prospective Grants/ Grants Research: 
Sarah and Denine plugged information into a 
Grants Calendar spreadsheet for planning and 
tracking; practiced using the Colorado Grants 
Guide to identify potential funders; Sarah and 
Denine reviewed the list and talked through 
an action plan for each funder. Thus far more 
than 5 potential grants have been identified.  
Sarah and Denine used the last meeting to 
review the application process for Virginia 
Hill, CHFA and The Denver Foundation.
Only had 3 months of access to the CGG, and 
they had an extension – but they had a lot of 
deadlines within the organization, so would 
have liked to have the grants research access 
longer...and more info on how to pay for it on
the sliding scale --> Marcy will follow up to 
provide more info about the subscription, also
the Denver Public Library has the grants 
guide
Denine feels like maybe if she had another 
month or so to dive into it, it would have been
more useful because she wanted to get the 
Colorado Common Grant done before looking
at the CGG. By the time she was ready to use 
it, they did not have access
Assistance with grant writing and 
improving their case for support for general 
operating.Organizational Assessment and Goals for 
Programming: Jorge worked to provide 
historical and current information; Denine 
fine-tuned goals to include measurable 
outcomes for certain programs and put 
together the evaluation section of the CGA.  
  
Attend the following training sessions:

?Grantwriting 201, Nov 7, 2024
?Finding Funding on the Web, Dec 5, 
2024Colorado Common Grant Application and 
Attachments:
Following the Get Grants Training, Denine 
and Sarah worked to fine-tune the CGA; SS 
offered suggestions for a strong proposal and 
helped trim it to the required 4 pages.  
Similarly, we reviewed and talked through the
Colorado Common Grant list of Attachments;
Sarah provided advice on how to gather 
missing information for financial reporting 
and an updated proof of 501(c)(3) status 
letter.  
Sarah and Denine worked together on 
creating a system for Budgeting that is strategic and demonstrates financial need to 
potential funders; together we crafted a 
proposed Organizational Budget for 2025 
attachment to include with proposals this 
year.
Able to complete the Common Grant & that 
alone was important. 
The attachments were huge, and they took a 
long time. So, working through that whole 
process...If I had just applied for a grant, I 
would have been frantically trying to put 
together those attachments. Working through 
the Common Grant was what was needed, the 
narrative and the attachments.

Recommendations for Next Steps GRANTS:
1.Spend a few hours each month conducting grant research; add to the current list of 
prospective grants; be sure to review carefully for alignment and when possible reach 
out to foundation before applying to talk through programs and determine if it is a 
match and how much to request. Add potential matches to Grants Calendar with 
information including deadlines; also document those that are not and why, may want 
to revisit some of these later.  This is a good place to also keep the login info for 
Online applications.
2.Follow the Grants Calendar and be sure to stay on top of deadlines; set a goal for how 
many applications will be submitted, monthly, annually to reach the revenue goals.
3.Set a goal to apply for at least one general operating (GO) grant each month; expect 
30% to be funded in the first year and grow from there; ie: apply for a total of $150K 
to receive $50K; if the proposal is declined ask for feedback when possible from 
contact at the foundation.
4.Review the notes/PPT from the CRC Get Grants, Grants 201 and Finding Funding on 
the Web Trainings that you attended; Denine- there has been a lot of inputs in the first 
few months since you started at CO CABE; would probably be helpful to review the 
information from the trainings; they are a great resource as you build your capacity to 
manage private foundation grants and before you consider applying for government 
funds.

","Denine: 1:1 sessions with Sarah, that was probably the most productive vs the Zoom 
sessions with everyone – those were the most valuable for the program. When I went 
to the sessions, we followed through the book pretty closely, but I couldn’task 
organization specific questions during those sessions. When I met with Sarah, I could 
ask those questions. Like Jorge said, we started from ground zero – we didn’t have a 
budget.. When we went to those sessions and said “this is how you do your books”, 
we didn’t have books... We are still waiting on our IRS Letter. A lot of those 
organizations already have their IRS Letter...Now, with those grants, Sarah said, 
“submit what you have and note that you’re waiting on yur IRS Letter.” I never 
would have known that
 Jorge:  Agrees that having that 1:1 attention was important – having Sarah look at 
how we can change things...We had to change our bookkeeping system to funders’

they need. Could there be additional training or resources that could be offered at a future 
date? Jorge liked the shorter time frame because it got them to somewhere quickly, but 
afterwards, it would be useful to have some follow up support months or even a year down 
the line."," 
When Sarah worked with Denine, she was working as an expert in Grantwriting, but she 
was also cheering me on to get stuff done that I was struggling with. Denine was brand 
new to this role, Sarah held her hand and guided through this journey...what did she need 
to know from the business side  Sarah was there on a personal level. When I was anxious
or struggling, she was the person that was calming and I really appreciated thatQuestion from Jorge: Is there anything else that CRC offers in terms of support 
Katy listed CRC’s programs/services, free resources on website, etc   > Katy will follow 
up with additional resources & mentioned follow up survey plan

Willowtail Springs Exit Meeting Document  - Copy.pdf,Willowtail Springs Nature Preserve and Education Center,"
Need more funding sources – such as general operating and 
capital grantsProspective Grants: Together with Avery we practiced using 
the Colorado Grants Guide to identify potential funders.  Avery 
developed a Grant Tracking Spreadsheet to streamline 
information by Funder/Grant opportunity, she also researched 
and included new potential funders to this list.
Succession planning for future leadership and sustainability 
of organization – Working towards building a bigger budget for
eventual replacement of Peggy and Lee (Co-Exec Directors)Ideas for Willowtail in the short-term:
1.Hire an Associate Director; who is interested in being 
groomed as the ED; even if they are part-time, someone 
who has experience in Admin/Fundraising/Marketing; 
consider offering a competitive salary or hire on a 
contract basis.
2.Focus on marketing so that WTS can maximize the 
funds they earn from property rentals
3.Apply for Virginia Hill  and possibly other small grants 
to supplement General Operating funds
4.Determine what can be offered to the community during
the year; conservation activities, community events, 
educational visits to the land,  and even a limited number
of residencies.
5.Work with Associate Director, Advisory 
Committee and any other key supporters to develop a 
short and long term plan for the organization; what it 
would take beyond this year to continue the work of 
WTS.
?Challenge continues to sustain the operation as a 
nonprofit and to bring in the resources that will 
allow this to happen. 
?Last year they had the DOLA NPI grant, and they 
don’t have the monies this year. 
?Challenge with capacity – run programs, run 
organization, fundraise. 
?Ideally would have someone at this time who could
follow her around and she could mentor that could 
take over the org. 
?And an Admin Assistant to track and report on 
funding. Even when you are awarded, there are 
reporting requirements. 
?They received CCI and the reimbursement took 6+ 
months. 
?The NPI grant had a lot of requirements. Was a lot 
of work and was $3-$4k on top for insurance. 
Current lease through 2027 : working towards purchasing 
propertyIf you pursue a Capital Campaign to purchase the building;
1-Determine what $ amount needs to be raised, I 
recommend building the capital budget to include 
repairs needed; 
2-Consider the idea of applying for a loan as well; there 
are foundations and nonprofits that offer low interest 
loans to other nonprofits; this may be better than a loan 
from a bank. 
3-Cast a wide net, send a letter that includes a brief 
description of Willowtail’s impact to date; the amount 
that is needed to purchase the land and revive the 
organization for at least 2 years: some of these will be a 
formal “letter of inquiry” followed by a grant proposal. 
4-Contact Gates and El Pomar foundations to inquire 
directly about applying for a grant for Capital funds. 
5-Put out a RFP for a consultant to lead the Capital 
Campaign; this person could focus on fundraising and 
transition
Initial Recommendations (made during Intake 
Meeting)Progress Made
Resources: Access to Information – Providing answers, 
information, and resources to specific questions relating to 
nonprofit fundraising; Colorado Grant Guide – Information 
about, and help signing up for and using the CGGProspective Grants: Together we walked through past funders 
and those who denied proposals in the past. Discussed the 
importance of alignment and timing and talked through strategies
for how to approach them again.
Training: Get Grants – zoom series; Grantwriting 201 – beyond
answering questions; Finding Funding on the Web; Funder 
Connections - monthlyOrganizational Assessment and Goals for programming:  
Initial Meetings with Peggy, Kerin and then introduction to Lee.  
Provided insight into the core of WTS; Provided insight into 
current challenges with Land/Property and ownership. Introduced
Logic Model to help understand inputs/impact.
Deep Consultations: up to 30 hours – direct and in-direct time 
– gather all items for strong grant submission; look at budget 
and needs for organization; develop  aspects of capital campaign;
create grants calendar; build on what already existColorado Common Grant Application and Attachments- 
Using information from past grant applications, newsletter, the 
website and additional information shared via email and 
conversations, Sarah developed a four page General Operating Template. We talked through a budget attachment that includes 
just enough detail for funders to understand the revenue streams 
and expenses.
Grants Archives: Avery assisted in creating a Folder on Google 
Docs to house all relevant information shared by Peggy  and we 
created a folder for Grants including the new CGA 
template and attachments. Some of these need to be updated with
information (Inkind and Major Donor attachments)

Support with finding grants for which they 
qualify
Assistance with readying their organization 
for further grant opportunities
Support with designing criteria for service 
eligibility
Assistance crafting grant narratives for its 
programs
Assistance pursuing capital grants for a van
Initial Recommendations (made during 
Intake Meeting)Progress Made
GrantCorps recommends that methods of 
finding monetary/material support for itself 
and its workers be investigated.
GrantCorps consultant to use grants checklist 
document to identify what 
documents/policies/procedures Walter has in 
place, and which ones he may need to further 
develop.GrantCorps VISTA members reviewed a 
grant readiness checklist with Willing, to see 
what documentation was or was not missing. 
VISTA members created a list of sample 
policy templates, ranging from board 
development to anti-discrimination 
statements, to help further develop the NPO.
GrantCorps recommends that program design 
and description be refined and made concrete 
so that the program’s structures and priorities 
can be communicated in grant narratives.Various work on this topic was done with 
Willing. Logic model training and support 
with more general policies necessary for grant
narratives were given.
Willing also would like a tag-line for the non-
profit, so that organizations don’t think they 
are a for-profit business. Willing would like 
help with how they are presented to the 
public.Several tag-lines/mission statements were 
presented. Willing seemed to find these 
satisfactory.
Other Things Explored

 Katy P. will send Walter an in kind letter outlining the value/service of the program; and 
what Willing received and accomplished as part of their participation in the program. 
 Email Walter the link to the training in Limon & other training links through August.  Walter ID’d some grants via CGG, and is planning to prepare grant applications in recent

Review (Reviewing past grants) & provide 
feedback: Review grants and their RFPs– that 
were denied based on direct services vs. 
capacity building and provide feedback.Discussed Colorado health Foundation grant;

objective because they wanted to focus on 
grant proposals being developed for future 
opportunities.

communicate a compelling case for support;  with a minimum of 
flowery language and a maximum of strong supporting 
documentation.”
Lack of information about funding 
opportunities, finding grants“having access to the Grants Guide, even for a few months, was 
eye opening. We discovered, with Amy Stahlin's support, some 
new options and new ways to approach past unsuccessful 
applications. I still have questions about how to open the door to 
funders who don't accept unsolicited applications but require a 
prior invitation. I know from past reviews of the 990s submitted 
from similar performing arts organizations in mountain resort 
communities that there are foundations who might be willing to 
listen to a Piknik Theatre proposal if they only knew we've been 
working since 2008 on the same missions they fund in Aspen, Vail,
or Telluride.
Awareness, viability, importance of arts “I take for granted that everyone knows the value of theatre , 
especially in a world increasingly enamored of ChatBot. The 
experience of real humans embodying real ideas and emotions in 
real time has become rare; or inaccessible if you look at the 
average price of a Broadway ticket. We offer free performances of
professional quality in a beautiful outdoor environment; what 
more needs to be said? Well, in a resort community infatuated 
with outdoor recreation, it's clear we've only scratched the 
surface of creating compelling arguments for supporting the 
performing arts. Thanks to your training and Amy's guidance , I 
think we can take our case for support to new levels and to new 
ears, while continuing to encourage ongoing assistance from past 
donors. One effort that Celina is leading is reaching out to our 
immigrant community and families with children who can 
connect with Piknik Theatre through our youth theatre camps 
and programs.” “Between using the grants guide, following the 
CRC and CCI newsletters, and the updates from the Yampa 
Valley Community Foundation, I think we've got a handle on 
grant applications that are open to performing arts work in rural 
communities. There's still that nagging question that invitation 
only foundations are unaware of what we do.”
Sustainability of leadership, staff at 
organization“ has been an ongoing issue as Piknik Theatre and I both have 
matured, so to speak. I recognize it's past time for younger 
hands and minds to take over leadership of the organization and 
hiring Celina as an executive director (while I remain as board 
chair and acting artistic director) is the first step. Now, we look to 
find funding support for organizational capacity as well as the 
actors, instructors, and performance related activities. Funding 
administration is never a hot button for donors but now that I'm 
no longer donating all of the organizational work, it's 
absolutely necessary. This issue is still unresolved.”
Collaboratively applying for funding – 
bringing together Performing Arts Alliance in 
Steamboat – to work together“this, too, is a recent development. I've bemoaned the silo 
mentality that's plagued local arts organizations for many years. 
Each nonprofit has jealously  guarded its list of donors with little 
interest in sharing. I think now that we're completing the region's 
first outdoor performing arts venue, there's some movement to 
join forces. Celina is exploring collaborations with the Steamboat 
Dance Theatre group and a relatively new nonprofit, 
Undiscovered Earth, is developing a small indoor performing 
space that they want Piknik Theatre and others to use.  It's 
unfortunate that the two biggest and longest established 
performing art nonprofits, the Strings Music Festival and Perry-
Mansfield Performing Arts Camp, don't want to share the 
sandbox.”
Initial Recommendations (made during Intake 
Meeting)Progress Made
Resources: Access to information, CGG “having access to the Grants Guide, even for a few months, was 
eye opening”
Training: 3-part training series “The individual zoom sessions were very well organized 
and presented. You've made the PowerPoint 
information and recordings available for future reference 
so we've got another resource in the tool box.”
Coaching: 
Grants narrative development  
oSaving time & incorporating key 
messages 
oCould develop youth in the arts 
specific messaging for kids’ 
programs
Grants research 
oCollaboration & potential NEA 
application and research“I think it's really too early to tell what outcomes will result
from the very thorough training you've provided. Certainly
we'll approach grant application writing with more 
confidence thanks to the knowledge gained. I think we'll be 
able to conduct searches for potential funders more 
systematically. We are definitely approaching youth theatre
education with more energy and enthusiasm, as this is a 
strength of our new executive director. Federal funding of 
the arts for the next four years (at least) will be confined to 
a narrow ideological focus that many performing arts 
groups don't support. Piknik Theatre has never looked at 
federal funding previously so that won't affect us directly; 
but the many other arts organizations who have depended 
on NEA or NEH support will now have to look elsewhere so
the competition for State and private foundation grants will
be far more fierce. I'm glad we were able to take advantage
of your training offer and to make stronger connections 
with CRC staff and professionals like Amy Stahlin as this 
networking is going to be invaluable in the trying times 
ahead.”

Stuart’s and Celina’s answer to overall program value : 
“Thanks so much for all you've done to support nonprofit organizations!! The 
GrantCorps program is but one of your very valuable contributions and Piknik Theatre 
very much appreciates your support. The individual zoom sessions were very well 
organized and presented. You've made the PowerPoint information  and recordings 
available for future reference so we've got another resource in the tool box. I think the 
one on one meetings with Amy  Stahlin were especially valuable as we could look at

breakout sessions could have been a bit longer to develop some stronger networking 
connections (if organized by general categories like human services, youth programming,

presentations are critical and perhaps additional optional breakouts after your 
presentations have concluded could be helpful for those organizations that have more 
time to share war stories and challenges. These could be facilitated by your Zoom room 
but not require your professional staff and support team to participate. ”"

Different visuals and ways of talking about it.
Gave examples of funder questions to better understand

?Didn’t get too far into grant planning 
with the short-turn around; did talk 
about future grants and tax status 
(509(a)3), which is precluding them 
from obtaining foundational grants 
right now (would like better 
information from funders about what’s
stopping them from giving to their tax 
status)
oA lot of organizations are 
starting to use the 509a3 status 
and feels that people think that 
means these organizations are 
to directly doing the work, but 
they don’t find that to be true
?Currently looking to change their tax 
status “this 509a3 status is not helpful 
[in finding grants dollars]” --> 
technically a subcategory of a 501c3 
organization. “I think it’s the 
perception that 509a3’s are not doing 
their own programming”

particular pieces of the CO Common Grant that you could be focusing on.",Unknown,"Grant research component – training & Amy walking them through CGG, how to 
utlize that more readily. And, her learning with how to research. 
** Feedback ** tax eligibility for grantors – what tax status do they fund. 
Better info from funders – what procludes them from giving to 509a3  type 3 – 
functionally integrated. CRC to have better understanding of tax status and how this 
pertains to grant funding. Talking to funders – about the “why” of why these orgs are 
not funded.","-Also participated in the VFRT – for the SW region; and id’ that tax status was 
prohibitive to eligibility","Scheduling could be difficult – matching up days/availability
 FLEXIBILITY – realizing people will have transition and new employees, be graceful

CHFA Direct Affect Award $8k Will hear this week! Last week of June 
2024. 
Sponsorships for the How-
To FestivalWere not awarded the Sponsorship 
requests. Was a partnership with 
Habitat for Humanity – and may have 
been confusing to Sponsors/funders as 
to the focus and the organization(s) that
were benefitting.
Next50 will open up next 
week (in July), and they 
intend to apply! 
","?“It was really useful to us that Amy lives here in Montrose with us… She knows the 
situation here.”
?Paying attention to our specifics. In classes, there is general stuff. But working with 
you guys, it’s more specific. 
?“How specifically it was aimed at us.”
?“Silas, Ivy, and Amy were wonderful. We learned a lot.”","?“We not only addressed the questions that came up in November, but much more than
that.”","activities and services provided by GrantCorps were most helpful to 
you and       
?The stuff that Ivy did. Eye opening. TBR called a special meeting with the person 
who runs their data in response.
?Everyone said that her (Meg’s) writing got better after working with Silas. 
Specifically using jargon and explaining the program in a way that resonates with 
funders. Learned things about presenting the things they are doing. 
?Having Amy as part of the team and having her in town was really useful.","Not yet. Getting ready. Applied for direct affect award through CHFA. Haven’t heard 
back yet. Sponsorships for How-To Festival, unfortunately did not get. Applied for 
$8,000, going to hear back   week (6/24-6/28)","Give us more hours.”
oWe really learned a lot. Now let’s talk about the finer details.
One area we never touched on and hope that we can – “How do we do our financial 
information in a way that doesn’t keep us so small? Going from a budget from $20,000 to
wanting to do a lot more, I don’t know how to present it. I don’t know how to be 
aspirational in our financials.”
One way to do that would be to give a list of things that we could talk about.”
“Presenting financials on that list.”","  
Budget was the big point to bring up
I can’t thank you enough and how very useful I think this is”
Suggestion: have in six months, a check in, to look at the work that has been done
Critique work again
